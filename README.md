This tool is used to convert protocol data from hexadecimal to binary, and after specific processing according to the protocol rules, convert the result back to hexadecimal format.
The protocol rules are as follows:

The input hexadecimal data (such as 43 07 e8 0c) will be converted to binary (such as 1001 0000 0000 0111 1110 1000 0000 1100).
According to the protocol requirements, remove the specified bit on the right (such as 100) to get a new binary value.
Convert the resulting binary data back to hexadecimal format (such as 12 00 FD 01).
This tool is convenient for communication protocol data parsing and conversion, and is suitable for embedded systems, network communications and other scenarios.
